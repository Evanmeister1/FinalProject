Memory Match
Description:
In Memory Match, players have to remember tones and press the corresponding buttons in the pattern of the tones. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the sequence lengthens after each successful round. Players interact with the game through the buttons and serial monitor, matching the sequences generated by the system. The serial monitor keeps track of how many times you get each pattern correct until the 10th pattern which is the last pattern before the end. 

Objective:
The objective of Memory Match is to replicate the sequences of tones generated by the game by pressing the corresponding button to each tone. Each correct sequence increases the player's score and the length of the sequence by 1, making the game progressively more challenging. 
Starting the Game:
Press the left button to start the game.
Sequence Playback:

The game generates a random sequence of tones, which is played back to the player.
Each element in the sequence corresponds to either the left or right touchpad.

User Input:
After the sequence is played, the player must replicate it using the left and right touchpads.
Touching the left pad plays the left tone and registers it as input.
Touching the right pad plays the right tone and registers it as input.

Scoring:
A correct sequence completion increases the player's score by 1 and makes the green LED lights 
flash.
The sequence length increases by 1 after each successful round.
Wrong sequence completion sets you back to 0 and LED lights flash red.


Victory and End:
Correctly reproducing the sequence 10 times in a row plays a victory tone and flashing rainbow leds. After that, the game goes back to round 1 as well as resets score.
